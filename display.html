   <div> <p style="font-weight: 700;"> Acrylic Paintings: </p> <p> My favorite medium to work in, 
      I have worked with acrylic paints for a very long time. The opacity of the paint and how quickly it 
   dries allows me to play with bright colors, and add as many little details i'd like. Which is always many! </p></div>
