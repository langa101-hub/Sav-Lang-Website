   <p> Savanna Rose Arts is a culmination of a hobby and a 
    love for all art forms that has been fostered over many 
    years. I was not born with a natural talent for the arts, 
    but through practice and patience i was able to hone my skills
    and turn this into an outlet for myself. This love has inspired 
    my future, my friendships, my view on learning something new,
    and most importantly who i aspire to be. </p>
